# Elastic Collisions Simulation  
A program that simulates elastic collisions. Written in C using WinBGIm graphics library.  
*This project was created for a 1st semester course.*  
  
**Structure of the input file:**  
<*number_of_spheres*>    
<*x1 y1 c1 m1 r1 sx1 sy1*>   
<*x2 y2 c2 m2 r2 sx2 sy2*>  
.  
.  
.  
<*xi yi ci mi ri sxi syi*>  

**xi, yi**: initial position of the ith sphere *(0<=xi<=600, 0<=yi<=400)*   
**ci**: color of the ith sphere *(0<=ci<=15)*  
**mi**: mass of the ith sphere *(0<=mi<=10000)*  
**ri**: radius of the ith sphere *(1<=ri<=100)*  
**sxi, syi**: initial velocity of the ith sphere (pixels/sec) *(-100<=sxi, syi<=100)*
